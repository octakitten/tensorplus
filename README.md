Tensorplus - a streamlined tensor library

Tensorplus is a Python package, written using C and Cuda, intended to be used by the Silky Project. 
Other applications and libraries may find it useful as well, and are welcome to use it as they see fit.
It is intended to be a lightweight solution that provides simple mathematical functions on tensors. It 
does not provide high level automation of ML functions or make your models for you, unfortunately. There
simply are some math operations that other major ML libraries don't do well or provide at all, and the 
author needed those functions for another project. Thus, this library exists.
