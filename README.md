TensorPlus

What is this?

This is a in-development Tensor library written in Cuda and C and ported to Python using CPython. If you'd like to test or use this library, feel free to download the wheel file from the /dist folder in the project directory and install it to your virtual environment with pip. This project aims at streamlining machine learning-relevant tensor operations that more popular, well-treaded libraries like Tensorflow and Pytorch have neglected. Specifically, it is built with the intention of being used by the OpenCB Project to speed up its operations.
